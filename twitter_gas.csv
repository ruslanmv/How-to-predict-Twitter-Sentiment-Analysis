Our appetite for gas guzzlers in America is part of that problem. But this started in the 70s with Nixon and the oil crisis. America is good at ignoring warnings because we are known to have short-fused memory.

Yeah, gas is always more expensive in #Canada compared to the US because it is more heavily taxed. In Europe you can feel your wallet get lighter when you fill up.
